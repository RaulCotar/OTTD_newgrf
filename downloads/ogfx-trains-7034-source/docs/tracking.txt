4 Summary of different cargos


1 Currently planned extensions
==============================
- wagon types supported:
    passenger,
    mail,
    valuables,
    open bulk,
    covered bulk,
    piece goods (covered),
    flatbed (not covered),
    tank (various looks, expensive refit)

- Two Generations with distinct look for
    passenger, (look: tbd)
    mail,
    valuables,
    open bulk (look: like default coal ore wagons)

==> the supported cargos need to be drawn for both wagon types
==> the empty wagons should look pretty similar (exception: liquid, partially flatbed + piece goods)
==> We skip climate dependence for now
==> We skip differenciation between rail, monorail and maglev for now
==> We skip further livery overrides for passenger engines for now

2 Immediate ToDo-List for Wagons

  Tanker wagon: the most unique wagon where each comes completely with its own sprites. Depending
    on that, empty and full needs to differ and 4 or 8 views are needed. Maybe some of the variety
    of the wagons can be used rather for a generational difference - and cargos more differed by
    symbols or colours?
    COLA,   cola                tank toyland            std                     empty + full (transparent?)

  Passenger wagon: with doors open and closed. Two generations. Is with and without people possible?
  Mail wagon: with doors open and closed, Two generations.
  Valuables wagon: with doors open and closed. Two generations.

3 Future additions
==================

  Next
    - Distinct wagons for monoral and maglev (e.g. again with the company-coloured line around)
    - Different presentations of the same cargo for the flatbed wagon
    - Random variation of the look for wagons (just slightly, like differently placed stains or so)
    - Colour-variation of the containers and possibly other cargos via recolour sprites
    
  Mid-term
    - Second generation flatbed wagons
    - livery override for some engines (for passenger, mail and valuables)

    - Metro trains?

  Long-term
    - Early generation of wagons with smaller sizes, different looks, introduction 1870 or so
    - Late generation of wagons with larger capacity and different looks, introduction 2050 or so
    - Early engines (starting about 1870)
    - Late rail engines (starting about 2050)
    - Differenciation between climates for passenger and mails
