/*************************************************
 * A brief explanation, compiled by Jasper Vries (FooBar),
 * taken from the DutchTrainSet
 * Railtype labels according to the Standardized Railtype Scheme
 * http://newgrf-specs.tt-wiki.net/wiki/Standardized_Railtype_Scheme
 *
 * TRACK GAUGE AND TYPE CLASS
 * All vehicles run on standard gauge track. The early steamers ran on
 * broad gauge, but we're not implementing that.
 * -> Class: S
 *
 * SPEED LIMIT CLASS
 * -> Class: A
 *
 * AXLE LOAD CLASS
 * This should be processed in the infosheet, simply by dividing the
 * engine/wagon weight by the number of axles, assuming a full load.
 * The lowest axle load in the set is 4 t, the highest is 34 t. All vehicles
 * are mapped linearly inbetween.
 * There will be five different axle load classes.
 * -> Class: A     0-10 t
 * -> Class: B     10-20 t
 * -> Class: C     20-30 t
 * -> Class: D     30-40 t
 * -> Class: E     40+ t
 *
 * ENERGY SOURCE TYPE CLASS
 * There are unelectrified, 1500 V DC electified, 25 kV AC electrified,
 * dual system electrified and 3rd rail electrified vehicles in the set.
 * -> Class: N     unelectrified
 * -> Class: D     1500 V DC
 * -> Class: A     25 kV AC
 * -> Class: E     dual system 1500 V DC and 25 kV AC electrified
 * -> Class: 3     third rail electrified
 *
 * STANDARD LABELS
 * All unelectrified will fallback to RAIL.
 * All electrified except third rail will fallback to ELRL.
 *
 * LABEL TABLE
 * Below is an overview of all railtype labels, in the form of an NML
 * railtypetable. Not all of the labels are actually used.
